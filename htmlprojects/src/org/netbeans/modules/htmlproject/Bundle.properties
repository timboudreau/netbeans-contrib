OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=Web & Java EE
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Support for directories containing HTML files as first-class projects.  \
    Automatically opens any dir named 'www' or 'public-html' as a project; other directories can be opened via New > Project. \
    Stores nothing inside your web directory that might clutter your web server. \
    Provides a flattened logical view of all HTML files in all subdirs of the project, listed by HTML title rather than file title, and support for 'building' (zipping) and 'running' (viewing). \
    Generally should be handy for doing documentation and articles.
