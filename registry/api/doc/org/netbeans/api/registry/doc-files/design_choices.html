<h2><a name="Design_Choices"></a>Design Choices</h2>

Designing API consists of considering wide rage of possibilities and
chosing the particular one for some reason. The important thing to keep
in mind is that API as a whole must be consistent and its individual
parts must fit into other smoothly and naturally. This often means that
solution for one concrete API part which seems as the best cannot be
used because it does work well with other parts of the API. <br>
<br>
This section tries to summarize some of the dilemmas and choices considered during
the design of this API and why some things were done this way and not
the other.<br>
<h3>Why the Preferences API was not used?</h3>
The Preferences API intentionally does not support objects handling.
The Preferences API as it names says is suitable for storage of
application preferences. However, handling of objects is requirement for
NetBeans. The NetBeans platform is customized by the objects registered
in the module's layer. The reasonable requirement is to have just one
API for manipulation of these objects and also for maniulation with
application preferences. At the end they are both just some settings.<br>
<br>
However, the Preferences API provider can be written which would use as
backend Registry API. This would allow users accustomed to Preferences
API use that API even in NetBeans and take advantage of subset of the
features of the Registry API.<br>
<h3>Why the JNDI API was not used?</h3>
The JNDI API was considered for a long time. There even exists
experimental implementation of the JNDI over NetBeans configuration
system - core/naming module. However this idea was discarded mainly for
these reasons:<br>
<ul>
  <li>too heavyweight for our needs. We need just subset of the
functionality and even this subset is sort of cumbersome for use in
client applications.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;JNDI Specification. The clear specification of behaviour of
JNDI is of course advantage, but in case of our particular usage of JNDI
it could be also limiting disadvantage.</li>
  <li>the JNDI originally was designed for enterprice or remote stuff.
Therefore exceptions as return values are quite appropriate solution. This
is not true for client applications which might query settings
frequently and catching exceptions would surely be performance problem.</li>
  <li>plain JNDI API is not enough for our needs. We would have to
create a few helper APIs anyway, e.g. support for defaults, handling of
primitive types, ordering, etc. Not mentioning that direct work with
JNDI API requires catching exceptions all the time and so it would be most probably wrapped into some helper class as well.<br>
</li></ul>The result is that we created Registry API which borrows a lot of ideas
both from the JNDI API and Preferences API and which suits better our
concrete needs in NetBeans.<br>
<h3>Binding-based API or binding-less API?</h3>
Why there is not just <br>
<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public interface <span style="font-weight: bold;">Context </span>{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String getName();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Context[] getChildrens();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Object getObject();</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String getAttribute(attrname);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // ... other methods<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
</code><br>
one single Context interface which represent both context and binding
as well. This is how FileSystem library treats files and folders - the
FileObject represents them both. Why the Registry API distinguish
contexts and bindings?<br>
<br>
This possibility was considered. There is no significant difference
between these two concepts. The binding-less concept is more natural
to people who are used to NetBeans FileSystem API; the binding-based concept is
used in Preferences API, JNDI API and also Windows Registry works the
same way. So in this light it was decided that easy of use of API and
its intuitiveness is more important. Comparison of these two approaches demonstrated on a few usecases <a href="bindingbased_vs_bindingless.html">can be found here</a>.<br><h3>The behaviour of some methods depend on whether the binding name is
passed or not.</h3>
Yes, all
ResettableContext methods accept null as value of the binding name.
Passing null value means that methods will operate on the Context itself
and not on the concrete binding: binding's attribute versus context's
attributes; reset of binding versus reset of whole context.<br>
<br>
This design is not nice but it is reasonable compromise. Other solution
would be to add several methods without this parameter, but this seems
to be worse that current solution.<br><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">TBD: </span>mention advantage of API/SPI separation<br>
