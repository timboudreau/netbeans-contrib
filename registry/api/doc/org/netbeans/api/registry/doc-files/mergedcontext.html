<h1>Merged context<br>
</h1>
There exists implementation of&nbsp; <code>org.netbeans.spi.registry.BasicContext</code>
which &nbsp;provides this basic functionality:&nbsp; merges subcontexts,
bindings and context attributes according their names for&nbsp;arbitrary
number of delegates and&nbsp;takes precedence&nbsp;in case of name
conflict. This implementation of <code>org.netbeans.spi.registry.BasicContext</code>
and also&nbsp; its API context is bellow called Merged Context.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="API"></a>API </h2>
Two factory methods were added to provide ability to create instance of
Merged Context:<br>
<ul>
  <li><code>public static Context</code><code>
org.netbeans.api.registry.Context.merge (Context[] delegates)</code><br>
    <br>
This method doesn't allow to dynamically change delegates.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>public static BasicContext</code><code>
org.netbeans.spi.registry.SpiUtils.merge (MergeContextProvider)</code><br>
    <br>
This method requires to implement interface <code>org.netbeans.spi.registry.MergeContextProvider:</code>
    <pre><code>public interface MergeContextProvider {<br>  public static final String PROP_DELEGATES_CHANGED = "PROP_DELEGATES_CHANGED"; //NOI18N<br>  public void addPropertyChangeListener (PropertyChangeListener listener);<br>  public void removePropertyChangeListener (PropertyChangeListener listener);<br>  public BasicContext[] getDelegates ();<br>}</code> </pre>
Implementation of Merged Context registers its PropertyChangeListener
and as soon as<code> PROP_DELEGATES_CHANGED </code>is fired, then method <code>getDelegates
()</code> is called and this invokes refresh of root context and all
live descendant subcontexts. This may cause, that <code>ContextEvents</code>
are fired.
    <p>Implementation of&nbsp; method&nbsp;<code>getDelegates () </code>requires
to return&nbsp; instances of some implementation of <code>BasicContext</code>.
In ther words it means probably to provide its own implementation of<code>
BasicContext</code>.<br>
    <br>
Return value of this factory method can be passed to method&nbsp; <code>SpiUtils.createContext</code>to
get&nbsp;<code>org.netbeans.api.registry.Context.</code> </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Lifecycle of objects</h4>
Any call of factory method creates new instance of Merged Context. This
instance can be considered as root which means&nbsp; its parent is null. &nbsp;<br>
    <p> All descendant subcontexts of this instance lives&nbsp; so long
as some non-Registry code is holding a reference to the object,
subsequent calls will return the same object. &nbsp;</p>
    <p> On the other hand Merged Context does not create new instances
for bindings, &nbsp;but delegates calls to its delegating contexts and
then there is only one object and it &nbsp;should be the same without
regard whether it was created from the regular Context or from the
Merged Context. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Merging</h4>
    <p> Subcontext, bindings and attributes&nbsp;provided by their
delegates are merged according their names. There is important that
there is taken precedence&nbsp;in case of name conflict. There is
true:&nbsp; the lower index in the array&nbsp; the higher
priority.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Merged Context provides subcontext for subcontext name&nbsp;
only if at least one of its delegates provides this subcontext.</p>
    <p>Attributes related to bindings are not merged at all. &nbsp; On
the other hand attributes related to context are merged from all
delegates.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If name for binding comes from two or more delegates, then the
instance from delegate with highest priority is returned from Merged
Context and also only this delegate with highest priority provides
attributes and attribute names for this binding.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Events</h4>
Merged Context listens on its delegates and&nbsp; Merged Context is
also source of events. &nbsp;Every modification on Merged Context fires
ContextEvent. But not all events fired originally from delegates are
propagated from Merged Context to its listeners, because not all changes
on delegates mean modification of Merged Context. <br>
For example:&nbsp; creation of subcontext on read-only delegate isn't
propagated from Merged Context in case, that subcontext with the same
name already existed on active delegate.
    <p>Listener registered on Merged Context will receive events about
modifications of this context and all its descendant live subcontext
instances. </p>
    <p>Destroy of subcontext destroys all descendant subcontexts and
&nbsp;naturally all descendant subcontetxs &nbsp;must fire
SubcontextEvents. </p>
    <p>There is obvious, that as soon as event is fired, then Merged
Context must be in consistent status, which means that added or modified
subcontext, binding or attribute must be reachable and on the other hand
removed&nbsp;suncontext, binding or attribute can't be reachable.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Delegates &amp; active delegate</h4>
All delegates may come from the same RootContex (in other words from
the same implementation of BasicContext and RootContext).
    <p>Active delegate is the one and the only one delegate with
special meaning among others:&nbsp; all modifications &nbsp;go into
active delegate (newly created, destroyed or modified subcontexts,
bindings or attributes). &nbsp;All other delegates are considered as
read-only. There is true that&nbsp; active delegate is the one with
index zero. </p>
    <p> Delegates of Merged Context may be instances of Merged Context
again. </p>
    <p>Method merge with zero delegates returns instance of context
impl., that has no content (subcontexts, bindings, attributes). This is
true for root context, else there won't  be returned no subcontext
instance if there is zero delegates. Zero-delegate merged context is
automatically read-only. </p>
    <p> Destroyed subcontexts, bindings and attributes from&nbsp;
read-only delegates must be masked on active delegate. &nbsp;Merged
Context isolates its clients from this mechanism and masks must be
considered as implementation detail.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Resettability</h4>
Merged Context provides resettable functionality&nbsp;and&nbsp; there
is possible to reset whole context or individual binding in context.
(see ResettableContext). &nbsp;
    <p> Binding has default value if there exists binding on one of
read-only delegates Binding is modified if &nbsp;this binding comes from
active delegate or there doesn't exist&nbsp; default value for this
binding. Revert of binding means destroy of binding on active delegate
and also destroy its mask. </p>
    <p>In the merged context, Context.hasDefault(null) will be true
when at least one read-only delegate has a context with the same path.
Context.isModified(null) will be true in case a context with the same
path exists on the active delegate (whether or not contexts with that
path exist on any of the read-only delegates). Context.revert(null) will
remove the context with the same path from the active delegate, if it
exists.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="open_issues"></a>Limitations, problems, open issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>there should be&nbsp; enhanced context merging with explicit
support for overriding. At the moment are things merged according to
order in array of delegates </li>
  <li>information about ordering provided by Merge Context is wrong and
useless (see default.context.sorting in
org.netbeans.core.registry.ContextImpl)</li>
  <li>use javax.swing.event.ChangeListener for one property instead of
java.beans.PropertyChangeListener ?<br>
  </li>
  <li>currently masks are considered to be only on active delegate;
masks on read-only delegates aren't taken into consideration</li>
  <li> delegates of Merged Context may be instances of Merged Context
again, but this is not true for active delegate </li>
  <li>masked stuff isn't filtered by Registry API (also active delegate
shouldn't provide masks)</li>
  <li>lack of right synchronization at the moment<br>
  </li>
</ul>
