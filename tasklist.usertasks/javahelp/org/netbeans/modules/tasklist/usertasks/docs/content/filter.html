<h2> Searching for Tasks/Filtering Tasks<br>



</h2>



To search for a particular task, or to only show
tasks matching a given set of criteria, use the
"Search/Filter..." context menu action. This will
bring up a dialog like the following:
<p><img src="images/filterDialog.png" alt="Filter dialog" style="width: 810px; height: 580px;"></p>



<p>Use the "New" button to create a new filter and "Delete" to
delete
the selected (current) filter. The "Preview" button allows to see the
results without closing the dialog.<br>



</p>



<p>To add additional search criteria, click on the
"More" button. To remove the last condition from
the list, click on the "Fewer" button. By default
a task is accepted if it matches <i>any</i> of
the conditions. Select the "Match all of the following"
checkbox to require <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> conditions to be met.
</p>



<p>If a task has subtasks, and the task itself does
not match the criteria but one or more of its
subtasks do it will cause the
(non-matching) parent task to be included in the tasklist, but with a
gray icon. This means you can still see the original structure of the
tasklist. Here's how this looks:</p>



<p><img src="images/parents.gif" title="" alt="Filtered view with unmatched parent tasks" style="width: 175px; height: 53px;"></p>



<p>Note that clicking on the "Search" icon in the
toolbar when a tasklist window is active brings
up the filter dialog.
</p>



<p>Filters are preserved from session
to session.
