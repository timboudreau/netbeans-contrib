<answer id="arch-overall">
    There are two kinds of API classes exposed by MDR:
    <ul>
        <li>The reflective JMI API and JMI interfaces generated for
            MOF metamodel. These are located in javax.jmi package.</li>
        <li>Proprietary <api name="MDRAPI" category="stable" group="java"  type="export" url="@TOP@"/> classes exposing additional functionality not standardized by JMI (even notifications mechanism, concept of a repository, JMI mapper, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    By MDR a new kind of API is introduced - JMI interfaces generated from a given metamodel.
    Since it is expected that the number of NetBeans modules that will use MOF metamodels
    and JMI API generated from them to manage metadata, it is desirable to establish come
    conventions for where the generated API should be located (in what packages),
    where custom implementations of those metamodels should be and
    some other concepts like naming of metamodels and repositories. Suggested target
    package for metamodel specific JMI interfaces is org.netbeans.jmi.

<answer id="arch-quality">
Since MDR is mostly an implementation of JMI standard, it can be tested using the JMI TCK test suite, which includes
    about 1000 tests for the JMI reflective and metamodel specific API. Besides that we have a set of unit and functional
    tests testing the proprietary extensions to the JMI standard. Performance regressions can be identified by our
    performance tests that are also included in our test suite. All of the tests except for the JMI TCK are built using
    xtest framework and can be run continuously.

            Can your module coexist with earlier and future

            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?

            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
The module itself stores no settings besides the b-tree storage files that are used to store the metadata. B-tree storage
    files do contain version information. If the module encounters an older version of storage files, the storage is automatically
    rebooted - i.e. all the stored metadata are lost at that moment. This is fine since MDR serves as a cache for the metadata,
    not as a primary source of the metadata.

The MDR introduces transaction mutex, which ensures atomicity of every operation.
    Each operation starts a transaction (uses mutex to lock the repository) upon the entrance
    and ends the transaction (i.e. releases the mutex) when exiting. The default implementation
    of the mutex supports multiple readers or single writter. The whole MDR is thread safe.

The module's performance is affected by the amount of data in a single storage file. Usually
   there is a 1:1 mapping between a repository and a storage file. Although the module does
    support storage partitioning and federation. Computational complexity of the searches in
    the default implementation of the storage (b-tree) is logarithmic, so the code should scale.
    Another thing that influences the performance of the repository is a number of listeners
    registered on various repository objects.<br/>
We should note however that currently there is a know bug in the b-tree storage which causes that
complexity of linking objects to a single object in an ordered association is quadratic.

No. However the first call to MDR made by any of its clients may potentially take a long time, since MDR is initialized lazily. During the first call to it the MDR checks whether the
storages are present or whether they need to be rebooted. If everything is OK, the first call takes about a second (caches are populated), otherwise it may take more time necessary for
rebooting the storage. Subsequent calls should be fast.

<answer id="resources-read">
Yes. The implementation of MDR manager reads list of registered metadata repositories.
    Currently the registration and discovery of the repositories works using a special
    dataloader for *.mdr files. So the repository needs to be registered in the layer
    as a file with "mdr" extension. Properties of the repository are declared as file
    attributes. This is an obsolete thing which we plan to replace with a different
    registration mechanism before the release. Here are the changes we envision
    (any comments are welcome):
    <ul>
        <li>Add setProperties(Map) method to the MDRepository interface - its contract will be
 that it has to be called once and only once and it has to be called as the first method
 on a given instance - this method will initialize the repository instance.</li>
        <li>Repositories will be registered in layer as *.instance files. All the properties
 of a given repository (passed to it in setProperties method as name-value pairs) will be
 declared as file attributes. An open issue is that it is expected that most modules will
 want to use (register a new instance of) the default implementation of MDRepository provided by MDR module - NBMDRepositoryImpl class.
 But this class is not in the API package. Is it a problem?</li>
