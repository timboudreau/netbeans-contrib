<answer id="arch-overall">
    There are two kinds of API/SPI classes exposed by MDR:
    <ul>
        <li>The reflective JMI API and JMI interfaces generated for
            MOF metamodel. These are located in javax.jmi package.</li>
        <li>Proprietary MDR API/SPI classes exposing additional functionality not standardized
            by JMI (even notifications mechanism, concept of a repository, JMI mapper, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    By MDR a new kind of API is introduced - JMI interfaces generated from a given metamodel.
    Since it is expected that the number of NetBeans modules that will use MOF metamodels
    and JMI API generated from them to manage metadata, it is desirable to establish come
    conventions for where the generated API should be located (in what packages),
    where custom implementations of those metamodels should be and
    some other concepts like naming of metamodels and repositories. Suggested target
    package for metamodel specific JMI interfaces is org.netbeans.jmi.
    <p/>
    Regarding the <api name="MDR API/SPI" category="devel" group="java"  type="export" url="http://www.netbeans.org/download/dev/javadoc/MdrAPIs"/>
    as previously said, API and SPI is currently mixed in subpackages of org.netbeans.api.
    Thus I included the following table that walks through the individual interfaces and suggests their
    final locations:
    <table>
        <th>Location</th>
        <th>Interfaces</th>
        <th>Note</th>
        <tr>
            <td><code>org.netbeans.api.mdr</code></td>
            <td><code>MDRManager, MDRepository, MDRObject</code></td>
            <td>These interfaces are primarily an API (although one may still want to
                provide a different implementation of MDRManager or MDRepository, it
                is not encouraged and the much more frequent scenario will be that people
                will use these interfaces as an API.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>org.netbeans.api.mdr.events</code></td>
            <td><code>AssociationEvent, AttributeEvent, ExtentEvent, InstanceEvent, TransactionEvent,
                MDRChangeEvent, MDRChangeSource</code></td>
            <td>Again, these are cleanly and API (note that MDRChangeListener and
                MDRPreChangeListener that are currently present in org.netbeans.api.mdr.events
                package are missing from this list. It is because they will probably be moved to
                org.netbeans.spi.mdr.events. Also we are planning to make the pre-change
                events vetoable, so a new exception will be introduced into this package.
                The exception will be named VetoChangeException and will extend
                javax.jmi.reflect.ConstraintViolationException.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><code>org.netbeans.spi.mdr.events</code></td>
            <td><code>MDRChangeListener, MDRPreChangeListener</code></td>
            <td>These interfaces should be moved from org.netbeans.api.mdr.events,

                have two - one that generates java files and the other one that

                class is a usage as an API.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>These are again primarily the API classes. Alghough they could be
                implemented by third parties and they implementations could replace
                ours using XML layer, this scenario is not encouraged. The DTDProducer
                class should be moved from org.netbeans.api.mdr, since it is an XMI
                specific interface.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>org.netbeans.spi.xmi</code></td>
            <td><code>XMIReferenceProvider, XMIReferenceResolver</code></td>
            <td>These classes should be moved from org.netbeans.api.xmi, since they
                are an SPI rather than API.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    </table>
    Things to consider by Architecture Review Commitee:
    <ul>
        <li>Is the separation of SPI and API suggested in the table above correct?</li>
        <li>Would it be better to move org.netbeans.api.mdr.events classes directly to org.netbeans.api.mdr
            package and forget about additional events subpackage.</li>
        <li>Is it a good idea to separate mdr, jmi and xmi API/SPI? Or should it all be
            under mdr?</li>
    </ul>

<answer id="arch-quality">
Since MDR is mostly an implementation of JMI standard, it can be tested using the JMI TCK test suite, which includes
    about 1000 tests for the JMI reflective and metamodel specific API. Besides that we have a set of unit and functional
    tests testing the proprietary extensions to the JMI standard. Performance regressions can be identified by our
    performance tests that are also included in our test suite. All of the tests except for the JMI TCK are built using
    xtest framework and can be run continuously.

<!--
        <question id="compat-version" when="impl">
            Can your module coexist with earlier and future
            versions of itself? Can you correctly read all old settings? Will future
            versions be able to read your current settings? Can you read
            or politely ignore settings stored by a future version?

            <hint>
            Very helpful for reading settings is to store version number
            there, so future versions can decide whether how to read/convert
            the settings and older versions can ignore the new ones.
            </hint>
        </question>
-->
<answer id="compat-version">
The module itself stores no settings besides the b-tree storage files that are used to store the metadata. B-tree storage
    files do contain version information. If the module encounters an older version of storage files, the storage is automatically
    rebooted - i.e. all the stored metadata are lost at that moment. This is fine since MDR serves as a cache for the metadata,
    not as a primary source of the metadata.

Implementation of MDR storage is pluggable. MDR creates the right storage factory based
    on its class name provided in start up properties using reflection. Same holds for
    pluggable transaction mutex. Custom implementations of collections use
    java.lang.reflect.Array to implement toArray method.
    Reflection is used to implement JMI reflective operations in RefStruct and RefEnum interfaces
    to access implementations of JMI non-reflective features. Bytecode generators use reflection

    Btree storage takes the value as uuid of the storage.

<answer id="exec-threading">
The MDR introduces transaction mutex, which ensures atomicity of every operation.
    Each operation starts a transaction (uses mutex to lock the repository) upon the entrance
    and ends the transaction (i.e. releases the mutex) when exiting. The default implementation
    of the mutex supports multiple readers or single writter. The whole MDR is thread safe.

<answer id="resources-read">
Yes. The implementation of MDR manager reads list of registered metadata repositories.
    Currently the registration and discovery of the repositories works using a special
    dataloader for *.mdr files. So the repository needs to be registered in the layer
    as a file with "mdr" extension. Properties of the repository are declared as file
    attributes. This is an obsolete thing which we plan to replace with a different
    registration mechanism before the release. Here are the changes we envision
    (any comments are welcome):
    <ul>
        <li>Add setProperties(Map) method to the MDRepository interface - its contract will be
 that it has to be called once and only once and it has to be called as the first method
 on a given instnace - this method will initialize the repository instnace.</li>
        <li>Repositories will be registered in layer as *.instnace files. All the properties
 of a given repository (passed to it in setProperties method as name-value pairs) will be
 declared as file attributes. An open issue is that it is expected that most modules will
 want to use (register a new instance of) the default implementation of MDRepository provided by MDR module - NBMDRepositoryImpl class.
 But this class is not in the API package. Is it a problem?</li>
