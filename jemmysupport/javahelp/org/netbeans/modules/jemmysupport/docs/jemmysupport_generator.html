First select destination filesystem and package for generated component
sources.
<p> <code><b>Create Screenshot</b></code> checkbox gives you an ability

same directory with the same name as generated component and with
extension <code>.png</code>. </p>
<p> <code><b>Show Component Editor</b></code> checkbox enables/disables <a
 href="#editor">Component Editor</a> appearing during process of
generation. It allows on-line editing of grabbed structure before
generated sources are finalized. </p>
<p> <code><b>Merge Conflicts</b></code> checkbox shows Merge Window in
case of conflict with already present component source. Than you can
control process of merging source differences.<br>
Filenames of newly generated sources are numbered to avoid conflicts
when Merge Conflicts checkbox is disabled.</p>
<p> <code><b>Use Component Name</b></code> checkbox enables that names
of components are used to their identification</p>
<p> <code><b>Start/Stop Component Generator</b></code> button
starts/stops thread waiting for some component to be focused and
CTRL-F12 key to be pressed.<br>
This button is enabled only when some package with write access is
selected.<br>
Component Generator is automatically stopped when its dialog is closed.</p>
<p> When generator is started and you see information message above Stop
button you can invoke and select the component to be grabbed.<br>
Selected components are highlighted by red border. Process of
generation can be started only by pressing CTRL-F12 key. Component
Editor dialog or Merger is displayed then in dependency of previous
selection. </p>

selected component on the left and properties of selected sub-component
in property sheet on the right.
<p> Any sub-component node can be deleted from tree by pushing Delete
key or by selecting Delete from its popup menu. </p>
<p> <b>Sub-component properties:</b> </p>
<p> <code><b>interanlLabels</b></code> property is list of text labels
found inside sub-component.<br>
These labels are used to generate <code>public static final String</code>
fields for some operators (JList, JComboBox...). </p>
<p> <code><b>shortName</b></code> property is used mostly for low level
method naming in generated source. </p>
<p> <code><b>uniqueName</b></code> property is used for unique
sub-component identification, for inner fields and sub-component getters
naming in generated source.<br>
Root nodes uniqueName represents its class and file name without
extension. </p>
<p> Note: uniqueName property is changed in dependency of shortName
property to simplify modifications. </p>
